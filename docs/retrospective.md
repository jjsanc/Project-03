## What Went Well
Unlike some programming languages, HTML and CSS provide instant visual results in a web browser. It made learning the process engaging and motivating. I could automatically see if my code come to life. HTML syntax and CSS styling made it straightfoward to pickup allowing me too create simple web pages.

## What Went Wrong
Some of the things that went wrong were syntax errors. Simple typos like forgetting to close a tag, a semicolon or a brace. I also had trouble with the CSS fundamentals like text font, color, size and spacing.

## What I will do Differently 
Instead of just following along with tutorials, I would start buliding my own website from scratch. I would dedicate more time to practice. I would also join online communities to ask questions and learn from experienced developers.
